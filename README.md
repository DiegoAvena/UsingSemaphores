## Overview 

This project simulates 2 seesaw riders named Fred and Wilma who take turns pushing up and down on a seesaw. Semaphores are used to insure that only 1 person pushes up at a time, allowing the riders to take turns. The output of the program contains the height that each person is at for each simulation run,  where 1 simulation is represented by a specific person going up and returning back down, or vice versa. The program is configured to perform 10 simulations.

## How to run 

1.) Compile with: make all 

2.) Run with: make run 

3.) To remove compiled code files: make realclean
