# UsingSemaphores


## Overview 

This project simulates 2 seesaw riders named Fred and Wilma who take turns pushing up and down on a seesaw. Semaphores are used to insure that only 1 person pushes up at a time, allowing the riders to take turns. The output of the program contains the height that each person is at for each simulation run,  where 1 simulation is represented by a specific person going up and returning back down, or vice versa.

## How to run
